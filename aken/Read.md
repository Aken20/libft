 	Rules
The game is played on a grid.



üîµüî¥ The Organisms
Organisms are made up of organs that take up one tile of space on the game grid.


Each player starts with a ROOT type organ. Your organism can GROW a new organ on each turn in order to cover a larger area.


A new organ can grow from any existing organ, onto an empty adjacent location.


In order to GROW, your organism needs proteins. Growing 1 BASIC organ requires 1 protein of type A.


You can obtain more proteins by growing an organ onto a tile of the grid containing a protein source, these are tiles with a letter in them. Doing so will grant you 3 proteins of the corresponding type.



You organism can receive the following command:

GROW id x y type: creates a new organ at location x, y from organ with id id. If the target location is not a neighbour of id, the organ will be created on the shortest path to x, y.

This command will create new BASIC organ with the ROOT organ as its parent.

See the Game Protocol section for more information on sending commands to your organism.


 	HARVESTER Rules
Organs you place may be given a direction.

This command will create new HARVESTER facing N (North).
If a HARVESTER is facing a tile with a protein source, you will receive 1 of that protein on every end of turn.


Note: each player gains only 1 protein from each source per turn, even if multiple harvesters are facing that source.


To grow a HARVESTER you need 1 C type protein and 1 D type protein.

 	TENTACLE Rules
On each turn, right after harvesting, any TENTACLE organs facing an opponent organ will attack, causing the target organ to die. Attacks happen simultaneously.

This command will create a new TENTACLE facing E (East), causing the opponent organ to be attacked.
When an organ dies, all of its children also die. This will propagate to the entire organism if the ROOT is hit.


Note: You can use the organParentId variable to keep track of each organ's children.


A tentacle also prevents the opponent from growing onto the tile it is facing.


To grow a TENTACLE you need 1 B type protein and 1 C type protein.


 	SPORER Rules
The SPORER type organ is unique in two ways:

It is the only organ that can create a new ROOT organ.
To create a new ROOT, it shoots out a spore in a straight line, letting you place the new organ in any of the free spaces it is facing.
Note: a ROOT organ never has a parent, even when spawned from a SPORER.



This command will make the SPORER shoot a new ROOT to the South.
When you control multiple organisms, you must output one command for each one. They will perform their actions simultaneously.


The requiredActionsCount variable will keep track of how many organisms you have. You must use the WAIT command for any organism that cannot act.


Note: You can use the organRootId variable to find out which organs belong to the same organism.


To grow a SPORER you need 1 B type protein and 1 D type protein.

To spore a new ROOT you need 1 of each protein.


Here is a table to summarize all organ costs:

Organ	A	B	C	D
BASIC	1	0	0	0
HARVESTER	0	0	1	1
TENTACLE	0	1	1	0
SPORER	0	1	0	1
ROOT	1	1	1	1

‚õî Game end
The game stops when it detects progress can no longer be made or after 100 turns.


üé¨ Action order for one turn
GROW and SPORE actions are computed.
Extra walls from growth collisions are spawned.
Protein harvests are computed.
Tentacle attacks are computed.
Game over conditions are checked.

Victory Conditions
The winner is the player with the most tiles occupied by one of their organs.
Defeat Conditions
Your program does not provide a command in the alloted time or one of the commands is invalid.

üêû Debugging tips
Hover over the grid to see extra information on the organ under your mouse.
Append text after any command and that text will appear above your organism.
Press the gear icon on the viewer to access extra display options.
Use the keyboard to control the action: space to play/pause, arrows to step 1 frame at a time.

Next entityCount lines: the following 7 inputs for each entity:
x: X coordinate (0 is leftmost)
y: Y coordinate (0 is topmost)
type:
WALL for a wall
ROOT for a ROOT type organ
BASIC for a BASIC type organ
HARVESTER for a HARVESTER type organ
TENTACLE for a TENTACLE type organ
SPORER for a SPORER type organ
A for an A protein source
B for a B protein source
C for a C protein source
D for a D protein source
owner:
1 if you are the owner of this organ
0 if your opponent owns this organ
-1 if this is not an organ
organId: unique id of this entity if it is an organ, 0 otherwise
organDir: N, W, S, or E for the direction in which this organ is facing
organParentId: if it is an organ, the organId of the organ that this organ grew from (0 for ROOT organs), else 0.
organRootId: if it is an organ, the organId of the ROOT that this organ originally grew from, else 0.
Next line: 4 integers: myA,myB,myC,myD for the amount of each protein type you have.
Next line: 4 integers: oppA,oppB,oppC,oppD for the amount of each protein type your opponent has.
Next line: the integer requiredActionsCount which equals the number of command you have to perform during the turn.
Output
A single line per organism with its action:
GROW id x y type direction : attempt to grow a new organ of type type at location x, y from organ with id id. If the target location is not a neighbour of id, the organ will be created on the shortest path to x, y.
SPORE id x y : attempt to create a new ROOT organ at location x, y from the SPORER with id id.
WAIT : do nothing.
Append text to your command and it will be displayed in the viewer.
